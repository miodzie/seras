# TODO
* Logging
  * ElasticSearch :O

* Configuration
```
connections:
  name: "discord 1"
  type: "discord"
    auth: "ENV?"
```

* Multiple Connections
  - Should be easier after Configuration stuff is setup.

* Interactive CLI

## Modules

* Word triggers

* RSS
  * Ignore words.
  * Item.Description character limit on String()
  * Better Message formatting (Impl MessageFormatter)
  * NotificationFormatter for RSS. For IRC, it'd be pretty annoying to have a
    giant wall of text.

* Legacy:
  - Points
  - Maybe kick
  - Meme Police
